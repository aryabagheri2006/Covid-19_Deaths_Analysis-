COVID-19 Data Analysis (SQL)
This project analysed COVID-19 data from Kaggle, focusing on infection rates, mortality, and vaccination progress using SQL. The analysis included:
•	Mortality & Infection Rates: Calculated death rates among infected populations and infection rates as a percentage of the population, identifying countries with the highest rates.
•	Death Counts by Location: Ranked locations by total deaths and deaths per population, highlighting high-impact areas.
•	Vaccination Progress: Tracked cumulative vaccinations with joins, CTEs, and temp tables, calculating the percentage of vaccinated populations.
•	Data Storage for Visualization: Created a view, PercentPopulationVaccinated, for easy access to vaccination data for future visualization.
This analysis offers a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 trends, enhancing the understanding of infection, mortality, and vaccination patterns globally.
